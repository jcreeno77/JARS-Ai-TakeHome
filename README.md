<b>This implementation uses Scriptable Objects to provide metadata to animations, and create buttons that can play character animations.</b>  
-The buttons can be filtered according to a category set by a scriptable object

For Style
-Tried to match style reference with colors and buttons  
-used Adobe Color wheel to find colors to indicate button functionality (like clicking, hovering, or selecting)  
-You can click and drag / swipe and drag screen to rotate the character  
-You can play/pause/restart an animation  


With more time I would:  
-Cleanup UI more, add an embossed / depth window to display the character  
-Add UI the functionality to support 100's of more animations (scrollbar, more filtering options like search)  
-Would do some profiling and optimization for handling loading of animations  
-Optimize UI Element scaling and sizing  
-Order some things in scene a bit better
